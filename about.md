I'm a curious person.  I like to take things apart, understand how and why they work, and then put them back together.  

During the day I'm a analyst and an IT manager at a consulting firm in the life sciences industry.  I help our clients solve complex problems through the use of data analytics, financial modeling, and the development of custom software tools.  When I'm not helping clients, I'm managing our IT infrastructure, both locally and in the cloud.

At night I'm an aspiring cyber security researcher, spending countless hours trying to hone and sharpen my skills.
